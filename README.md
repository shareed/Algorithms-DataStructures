# Algorithms-DataStructures
- a series of steps taken to solve a particular type of problem, the actual inputs given may be different
- take in some number of inputs and produce some kind of output
- a program is made up of multiple smaller algorithms
- we use time and memory resources to rank and evaluate algorithms(they are ranked by their time and memory requirements)
- an algorithm that runs faster and requires less memory is going to be a superior one
- it’s rare that an algorithm for a difficult problem will be able to have both fast speed and less memory
- the way input data is structured and organized can have a big impact on the performance of an algorithm – or how that algorithm can be designed in the first place
- The different ways of organizing data in programs are called data structures 
- designing an efficient algorithm requires using the right data structure, so it’s important to know your options before you start
**The programs you write for fun might not benefit from improvements to algorithmic complexity, but these concepts matter a lot to every software company in the world.If their software is too slow, their users are less productive.If a webpage takes too long to load, nobody will look at it.Strong algorithms can be the difference between success and failure for a startup.**
